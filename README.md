This Project analyzes the performance of The Los Angeles Lakers from their 2024-2025 Season in the NBA. This project shows team and player performances of games played between the months of October to January. I first created an Excel Sheet and used data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2025.html to guide me in using accurate data. Then I created a Python Script that read the data from the Excel Sheet and transferred it to a MySQL Database. Then I cleaned up the data in MySQL as well as adding new columns along the way that were needed for the following step. Lastly, I connected my MySQL server to Tableau where I created multiple visual dashboards!
